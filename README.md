## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an advanced Object Detection System using the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. The system aims to identify and classify objects within images with high accuracy and efficiency.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Object Detection:** Utilize state-of-the-art algorithms to detect objects in images.
- **Dataset:** Leverage the COCO dataset, which contains a large number of images with annotated objects across various categories.
- **Model Training:** Train deep learning models to recognize and classify objects in diverse contexts.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the model using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
